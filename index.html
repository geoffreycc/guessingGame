        Biography
      </h2>
      <p>
        I was born in Redmond, Washington in 1986. I completed my AA degree at Bellevue College. I dropped out of a BFA program for computer graphics at Academy of Art University in San Francisco. I have worked as a game tester at Nintendo since returning to Washington.
        I enjoy drawing and painting in my free time. I also play tabletop games.
